Our goal is to help and empower women towards safety and better circumstances. As of today, AVOICE's service region spans three continents and 30 countries, covering all European Union countries, the UK, North America and Australia.</p></div></div><hr><div class=col-md-12><div class=gallery-item style=background-color:#fdd7b8 style=cursor:pointer onclick='$h=$(this),$h.next("div").slideToggle(100,function(){$h.children("i").attr("class",function(){return $h.next("div").is(":visible")?"ti-angle-down":"ti-angle-right"})})'><h5>Program Abstract</h5><p>01</p></div><div class="collapsible-content pt-2 pb-5 ml-2 mr-2"><p>Against Violence to Overseas Chinese Women Program (or Avoice, for short) was launched in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Therefore, Avoice took several countries as examples, combined the number of local Chinese and the domestic violence rate, and then estimated the scale of Chinese women hurt by domestic violence. The result is shown in the figure above.</p><h3 id=problems-and-needs-of-overseas-chinese-women-in-domestic-violence>Problems and Needs of Overseas Chinese Women in Domestic Violence</h3><h4 id=1-the-existing-domestic-violence-relief-system-cannot-meet-special-needs-of-overseas-chinese-women>1. The existing domestic violence relief system cannot meet special needs of overseas Chinese women.</h4><p>It makes them unable to obtain financial and safety guarantees in a timely and sufficient manner to maintain their daily lives.</p><h4 id=2-overseas-chinese-women-lack-the-willingness-to-seek-help-through-official-channels>2. Overseas Chinese women lack the willingness to seek help through official channels.</h4><p>Due to their lack of understanding of local laws and regulations about domestic violence, together with insufficient awareness of legal rights protection and anxiety as migrants, they are less likely to seek help through official channels while experiencing domestic violence.</p><h4 id=3-it-is-difficult-for-them-to-get-support-from-external-social-relations>3. It is difficult for them to get support from external social relations.</h4><p>As an ethnic minority, it is difficult for them to get support from external social relations, because language, culture and nationality all act as hurdles in their better integration into local society.</p><h4 id=4-they-lack-ability-and-awareness-of-self-protection>4. They lack ability and awareness of self-protection.</h4><p>The vague understanding of domestic violence, the lack of self-protection education and the deep-rooted traditional gender concept have severely weakened their awareness of taking domestic violence precaution voluntarily and their ability of self-rescue.</p><h4 id=5-they-pay-less-attention-to-domestic-violence-against-overseas-chinese-women>5. They pay less attention to domestic violence against overseas Chinese women.</h4><p>Attention to overseas Chinese women, a marginalized group, is obviously insufficient. There has been no in-depth study, let alone relevant comprehensive intervention programs. Therefore, overseas Chinese women, who are at high risk of suffering from domestic violence, have become the neglected and silent group in the protection system for victims suffering from domestic violence.</p></div></div><div class=col-md-12><div class=gallery-item style=background-color:#fdd7b8 style=cursor:pointer
