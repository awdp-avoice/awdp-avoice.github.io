However, the high gender equality rating does not mean that domestic violence against women in Singapore is not a serious problem. According to Singapore&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Social and Family Development, from 2012 to 2016, domestic violence against women accounted for 74 to 76 percent of all cases, while domestic violence against men accounted for 24 to 25 percent during the same period.</description></item></channel></rss>
