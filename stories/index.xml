Introduction Despite accounting for half of the world’s population, women are still defined as a &amp;ldquo;gender minority&amp;rdquo; by the international community. Like the LGBTQ community, women are still under the constraints of systemic sexism and hidden exploitation despite existing ethics that promote tolerance and understanding. What&amp;rsquo;s even worse is that we&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to much of this oppression.

But when violence strikes, blind self-defense could turn the victim to be the criminal, getting the vulnerable groups into the mire.
Therefore, before protecting ourselves from harm, we should all know how to walk a fine line on bravery and what is the bottom line of protection, so that “self-defense” can exert its maximum effectiveness within the law.</description></item><item><title>With the courage to follow one’s heart and an independent self, everyone can be an oasis</title><link>https://awdpi.org/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awdpi.org/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/</guid><description>Evelyn is a professional psychologist with knowledge of landscape architecture.

Aggression in girls often emerges insidiously in intimate relationships, especially during adolescence, when girls are more likely to be sensitive and vulnerable. Aggression caused by abnormal social norms puts both the bully and the bullied in danger, and the distinct indirectness and elusiveness of this "alternative aggression" also makes it more difficult for schools and parents to intervene and respond. Under such circumstances, acknowledging the prevalence of violence among women and changing the public perception of this "</description></item><item><title>It's not about numbers: It is the stark reality of the lives of millions of women around the world</title><link>https://awdpi.org/stories/20220925_violence_behind_data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awdpi.org/stories/20220925_violence_behind_data/</guid><description>Sixteen years ago, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for intensified efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and requested the Secretary-General of the UN to establish a database to illustrate the extent, nature, and consequences of violence against women and to explore the effectiveness of policy programmes to eliminate violence.

&amp;ldquo;For domestic violence, it is zero times or thousands of times.&amp;rdquo;
Everyone knows this saying, but few people can get out of the mire of domestic violence.
In this era featuring information overload, it is hard to believe there are few platforms that speak up for victims of domestic violence. We should pay more attention to how can victims of domestic violence face their diﬃculties, defend their rights and get out of the nightmare of domestic violence, especially when they have to take their families and friends into consideration and the public has stereotypes about Chinese women.</description></item><item><title>Soon 30, I Want to Become an Independently Standing Tree</title><link>https://awdpi.org/stories/20211219_soon_30_independent_tree/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awdpi.org/stories/20211219_soon_30_independent_tree/</guid><description>Catherine
