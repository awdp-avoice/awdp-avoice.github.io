to name you Yoko!&rdquo;</p><p><span>Yoko Suzuki is the protagonist of the novel Scream, written by Japanese
novelist Aki Hamanaka.</span> Born on a brilliantly sunny and cloudless day, she was
therefore given the poetic name Yoko.</p><p>However, her name was actually casually decided by her parents. In the
second baby boom, 2.09 million babies were born, and Yoko was one of the
most common names given to baby girls. In contrast, Yoko’s younger brother,
Jun, was given his name after their mother bought and read quite a few
books on name-giving and chose it from over twenty preliminary options. <span>As
a girl, Yoko was destined to be the unimportant one in the family and could
not receive the care and love she longed for.</span></p><p><span>She was like a goldfish, unable to jump out of the fish tank. Trapped in a
suffocating life, no matter which way she turned, there was always an
unbreakable glass wall.</span></p></p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/1.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%></div><br><div class='row col-1 mx-auto px-5 py-3 justify-content-center font-weight-bold' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff>#1</div><br><p class="text-lg-center font-weight-bold h5"><span>Family, masked with fake happiness</span></p><p>&ldquo;I actually preferred a boy.&rdquo; Their mother once nonchalantly and bluntly told
Yoko the truth. After Jun was born, she always said with joy, &ldquo;I have hoped to
have a son for so long and finally.&rdquo; I am really happy about this. &ldquo;Ah, I even
feel that giving birth to this boy is the mission of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>This is a family where a girl could receive no love. Growing up, Yoko was
constantly haunted by questions like &ldquo;Why am I not as good as my younger
brother?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Why am I not loved and cared about in this home?&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Why
does my mother play favorites?&rdquo; But there were no simple answers. These
questions are entangled with issues of gender and patriarchy. As a victim and
as an innocent child, Yoko, who grew up in oppression and neglect, could not
see the underlying causes of her situation at all. As a young child, she felt
broken inside, as if there were a hole in her heart. Filled with emptiness, she
blamed herself for being unable to fulfill her mother’s expectations. Gradually,
she grew into a self-abasing outcast of society, longing for love, recognition,
and escape.</p><p><span>Why did Yoko’s mother act in this way? Perhaps it is a result of the
patriarchal ideology passed on to her. Even though she was a woman, after
unconsciously internalizing misogynist ideas while growing up, she gradually
developed a misogynist attitude towards her own daughter.</span></p><p>Yoko’s grandfather always said to her mother, who was born in the first baby
boom after the Second World War, &ldquo;There’s no need to go to the university.&rdquo;
What is the point of studying for a woman? &ldquo;A moral woman is talentless!&rdquo;
Back in the day, the workplace was where women prepared themselves for
marriage. They looked for their marriage partners there and did office chores,
which were commonly seen as a form of bridal training. Many women would
leave the workforce and return home after finding someone to marry, and so
did Yoko’s mother. After getting married, she quit her job and became a
housewife who cooked for the family, cleaned up the house, and looked after
the children. That was what she considered her life plan, for she believed that
the best family was one where men were breadwinners and women were
homemakers.</p><p>But is that really the best? Yoko disagreed. &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; was constantly on
her mother’s lips. She also frequently asked Yoko to compare her life to that
of the children living in the slums to teach her that contentment is happiness.
Notwithstanding, Yoko still believed that happiness was merely a mask that
covered the truth about family. <span>This was not just because she had been
treated unfairly by her mother, but because she had witnessed her mother
suffer sexual violence from her father when she was just a child.</span></p><p>When the fake happiness collapsed, Yoko was not prepared. One night, she
accidentally found that her parents were having a fight over her father’s
infidelity. The quarrel in which her mother was supposed to have the upper
hand ended with her father’s brutal sexual violence against her mother. She
witnessed her mother, who always faked her smile and never acknowledged
her faults, surrendering under violence, seeking no help, and putting up no
resistance. Yoko shivered with fear all of a sudden. The empty shell of family
that had confused her fell apart, and all good memories vanished. Everything
about this happy family, including the smile on her mother’s face every day,
was fake.</p><p>Later, Yoko’s brother died in an accident. Her father ran away from home due
to debts. Their house was mortgaged. Her mother sought refuge with their
relatives. After this series of events, Yoko left her family, which had shackled
her since she was a child, escaping from the suffocating fish tank. However,
what awaited her was not an ocean where she could freely explore and live
her life.</p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/2.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><p><br><br></p><div class='row col-1 mx-auto px-5 py-3 justify-content-center font-weight-bold' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff>#2</div><br><p class="text-lg-center font-weight-bold h5"><span>Love, as fragile as bubbles</span></p><p>Yoko left her home and started to live alone, like the women of the new
generation depicted in magazines. Getting on a new path and starting all
over, Yoko felt refreshed and excited. It is at this phase that the most dreamy
plot in the whole book took place—Yoko reunited with Yamazaki, for whom
she used to hold unrequited love. And more &ldquo;luckily,&rdquo; she found that he had
felt the same way.</p><p>Yamazaki was Yoko’s first love. They knew each other from their middle
school’s art club. They used to draw together, talk together, and enjoy each
other’s company on their way home. Later, Yamazaki moved and transferred
to another school, and the two lost contact with each other. When they saw
each other for the last time, he missed the chance to confess his feelings to
her. Ten years passed. Yoko and Yamazaki met each other again in a
convenience store. Now, Yamazaki was an unknown yet up-and-coming
manga artist, and Yoko was an ordinary girl working part-time. Drawn closer
together by memories of the past, the two saw their reunion as destiny. &ldquo;As
long as I am with you, I have the strength to face challenges.&rdquo; I need you.
&ldquo;Please come with me.&rdquo; Yamazaki said to her. Being needed, a feeling that
her mother and her family had never offered her, was what Yoko yearned for
for years. Soon after their reunion, the two got married.</p><p>Yamazaki’s job required him to live in Tokyo or its outskirts, which ignited the
longing for Tokyo that Yoko once had when she was dreaming to escape her
family. The newlywed couple headed towards the city of
dreams—Tokyo—the one Yoko had once yearned for and even thought she
would never get a seat in. There, Yoko first took the job of telephone
answering, which involved tedious trifles and constantly getting scolded. She
was striving for her dream future, and her life was mundane but happy. Two
years later, Yamazaki’s setbacks at work and his affair strained the
relationship between the two. The happy reunion was gone with the wind.</p><p>Her love life after their marriage was so tragic that police officer Ayano
Okunuki could not bring herself to tell him about it. Yoko gets married a
couple of times, but none of her husbands survived except for Yamazaki. In
her second marriage, Yoko married a man who abused her verbally and
physically and depended on her. In her second job, her boss treated her like
a money-making tool. Both of them were to blame for Yoko’s further
decadence. <span>It can be said that Yoko was tumbling again and again in the
emotional world due to a lack of salvation from herself and help and
understanding from others. Her ego had been fading away and was
eventually lost in her pursuit of recognition and the feeling of being needed.</span></p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/3.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><p><br><br></p><div class='row col-1 mx-auto px-5 py-3 justify-content-center font-weight-bold' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff>#3</div><br><p class="text-lg-center font-weight-bold h5"><span>Money, an endlessly recursive trap</span></p><p>The marriage institution in Japan stipulates that only women need to wait for
six months before they can remarry, so Yamazaki seamlessly moved on to his
second marriage after divorce. At the same time, Yoko was looking for a
more stable and higher-paying job to give herself a better, more secure life.
She entered a new company later on and became an insurance saleswoman
who had to find her own clients and hit her performance targets. She took it
as the beginning of a new life, but it did not lead her to a better future.
Instead, she sank into an abyss.</p><p>At first, Yoko enjoyed what her high salary brought her. She spent the money
she earned on her appearance and rent. But as her clients reduced, she was
stuck in the setback. Faced with her need for large expenses as well as
verbal violence and spiritual temptation from her boss, Yoko blamed herself.
She thought that she had setbacks at work because she did not work hard
enough and that she had disappointed her boss. She then tried harder by all
means to win recognition and compliments from her boss. She sold her body
to win her clients and to earn more money, which she then used for shopping.
Yoko, eventually, fell into the trap and was stuck in the endless loop of selling
her body and earning money, which she was unable to break. The way she
earned money gradually crossed the line towards crime and darkness.
Unfortunately, Yoko was only a money-making tool for her boss, although
she had given all she had. In the end, Yoko was forced to leave the company
because she offered sexual services to clients. Yoko, who had been given a
name with the denotation of the sun and light, gradually stepped to the
bottom of the abyss.</p><p><span>Yoko’s stepping into the abyss is the main plot of the mystery novel. The
book begins with the discovery of a dead woman who lived alone, which
leads to the rest of the story.</span></p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/4.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><p><br><br></p><div class='row col-1 mx-auto px-5 py-3 justify-content-center font-weight-bold' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff>#4</div><br><p class="text-lg-center font-weight-bold h5"><span>Concluding words</span></p><p>Considering that Scream is a mystery novel, the above parts are just brief
introductions to the major plots of Yoko’s journey into the abyss. in order to
not spoil the fascinating plots. As a whole, the book’s interlocking plots are
compelling. Not only does it cleverly incorporate elements of the era in Japan,
including people dying alone, earthquakes, and the baby boom, but it also
epitomizes the lives of women under patriarchy, presenting a story that is
worth reading, savoring, and thinking about.</p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/5.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><p><br><br></p><div class='row col-1 mx-auto px-5 py-3 justify-content-center font-weight-bold' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff><img width=35 height=35 src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/pencil.png></div><br><p><span>The female image of Yoko in the book can be taken as a starting point for us
to observe and reflect on the survival and existence of women.</span> We can see
Yoko was unfairly treated under the patriarchal system since she was born,
which turned her into a person desperate for recognition from others, even in
her relationships. It was also the reason why she gave away her body for her
career, to win recognition from her boss and earn money.</p><p>It was a pity that Yoko was not understood or helped when she was
continuously going through verbal, physical, or psychological violence and
oppression. She did not ask for direct support either. Therefore, even though
Yoko had been dreaming of escaping the goldfish-bowl-like world where
she felt suffocated since she was a little girl, she still ended up losing her
direction after setbacks.</p><p>&ldquo;Human existence is just a natural phenomenon that is fickle and uncertain.&rdquo;
Yoko constantly identified herself with the same saying. She used it to
soothe the pain she experienced and to excuse her crimes as well. But in
reality, our lives are not &ldquo;natural phenomena.&rdquo; We cannot experience Yoko’s
life personally, so we cannot blame or resent her as if we were moral
inquisitors. <span>If similar things happen to us or around us, we can try to discern
the forms of bondage in which women are held and avoid or prevent them,
even when confronting the ubiquitous oppression from the outside. We can
seek assistance from institutions or others or gather the power of women to
make change and activate human initiatives so as to save people from
becoming another Yoko.</span></p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221013_girls_behind_suspense_novels/6.png class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><p>Women are often defined and restricted since they are born because of the
gender they are assigned at birth. We hope that more women will wake up to
the constraints and injustices. <span>And we hope that they will try more, see more,
and develop the ability to think independently. We aspire to a world where
women are subordinate to no one and can become independent individuals
who love themselves before anything else.</span></p><p>Wholesome personalities, wisdom, courage, and accountable institutions are
the best game changers. <span>We want to popularize women’s protection groups,
bring women’s power into play, and encourage women to ask for help when
necessary, which is also the prospect Avoice has seen since its foundation.</span></p><p>Yoko is a name that denotes a clear sky. All Yokos should be standing in the
sun. In this ever-changing era, let’s make it come true with our own efforts.</p><p><br><br></p><div class='row d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center text-center'><div class='col-1 px-1 py-3 mx-auto'><div class='col-3 px-2 py-2 mx-auto' style=background-color:#f8ca45></div></div><div class='px-5 py-3' style=background-color:#ee7919;color:#fff>End</div><div class='col-1 px-1 py-3 mx-auto'><div class='col-3 px-2 py-2 mx-auto' style=background-color:#f8ca45></div></div></div><p><br><br></p><div class="card p-4 border-warning"><div class=card-body><span>Avoice海外华人女性保护项目介绍链接：</span>
