architecture. She seems to be very special to have been given a mission to
"save others" even before she was born. Although she experienced the
struggle between reality and ideal on the way to growing up, fortunately, she
still becomes a nourishing "oasis," literally like her name</p></div><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>When it comes to Evelyn, we'd rather call her "Oasis in the Desert."</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><p>Evelyn had an artistic birth name, &ldquo;Gezhou.&rdquo; When we first met her, we
wondered if there was a beautiful story behind the name.</p><p>&ldquo;I grew up in the northwest, where there are a lot of deserts. &ldquo;My father, even
before I was born, thought that no matter if I was a boy or a girl, I should be
called Gezhou, <span>like an oasis in the desert, to heal people and give them
hope.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>However, Gezhou seems to have had trouble getting along with this poetic
name for a long time. Although she has always understood where the name
came from and what it meant, as a child she struggled with gender
misidentification due to the name and how much power it carried.</p><p>&ldquo;As a child, I used to deliver food to stray animals. On my way of growing up,
I have always wanted to pursue an altruistic career, but it was when I grew up
and became a professional psychologist that I really felt I was up to what the
name meant. &ldquo;<span>It becomes my creed and deepens my understanding of it
through constant practice.</span>&rdquo;</p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/1.jpeg class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>Only by having the courage to follow one’s heart and independent self can
one become an oasis</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><p>Before becoming a professional psychologist, Gezhou thought she would be
a miserable landscape architect. Although she had dreamed of studying
psychology in high school, she was defeated by reality when it came time to
declare a major in college.</p><p>&ldquo;Because my family was not very supportive, and the career path of
psychology in China was not clear at that time, I chose landscape design
based on my hobby of painting, <span>but then I realized that hobby and passion
are completely different things.&rdquo; &ldquo;Without talent and real passion, it was hard
for me to keep going.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>Fortunately, this &ldquo;painful&rdquo; detour not only built up Gezhou’s willpower but
also helped her pinpoint where the real passion lies. Thus, she firmly followed
the voice of her heart and went to New York to study psychology after
graduation. In the process of studying in the United States, she did not feel
any suffering, even though she encountered many difficulties. This heartfelt
love made the so-called twists and turns shine brightly and brought her
closer to her dream, step by step.</p><p>After graduating with a master’s degree, Gezhou chose to stay in the United
States and work as a professional psychological counselor. Like all
youngsters who just enter society, the real world they encounter during their
work is way darker than any of those depicted in the books. Sometimes she
felt enveloped by a layer of gray, and <span>a strong sense of powerlessness came
over her.</span></p><p>&ldquo;I encountered the most difficulties, challenges, and insights in my first four
years.&rdquo; I didn’t have much social experience when I just graduated. Besides,
I have been well protected by my family since I was little, but in my first job,
I had to face and come into contact with many of the evils of society. As a
result, I also suffered from vicarious trauma and was deeply involved in the
experiences of visitors feeling powerless.</p><p>Research has found that <span>it takes survivors of domestic violence an average
of seven attempts to successfully overcome their adversity and receive help.</span>
Nonetheless, even after receiving help, some survivors, for one reason or
another, have to return to the environment from which they fled. In addition,
because of these toxic relationships and experiences, their fundamental
values can be profoundly changed. They will find the world very dark and find
it hard to believe that their lives will get better. It’s a strong feeling of
powerlessness for the survivors themselves and for us as counselors. When I
was dealing with these cases, my supervisor would remind me not to get
caught up in these feelings. &ldquo;While empathizing, we learn to think beyond the
client’s experiences and into their problems from a more professional
perspective.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2020, the first year of the epidemic, Gezhou was promoted to director of
her institution’s mental health clinic in the United States. However, a year
after her promotion, she chose to return home. It wasn’t just
the identity issues that limited her career in the United States or the
homesickness of being on the move. For her, returning home holds some
special meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very family-oriented person, but it’s hard to be truly independent if
you’re around your parents all the time.&rdquo; Therefore, my initial goal of going
abroad was to experience a different life through this physical separation
and realize personal independence at the same time. &ldquo;During my stay in the
United States, I gradually realized my maturity and independence in
personality, and I knew that the original goal had been gradually realized.&rdquo;</p><p>In the interview, we could always intuitively feel Gezhou’s love for psychology
and the positive influence brought by his experiences studying and working
in the United States. <span>We believe that it is the courage to follow the heart and
the independent self-realization brought about by this profound life
experience that make her like an oasis in the desert.</span></p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/2.jpeg class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>If you want to enter the hearts of others, start from the small</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><p>Gezhou has extensive experience in counseling in the United States. Her first
job after graduating with a master’s degree was to provide counseling
for women in New York City, coaching and offering therapy to help them
reenter the workplace and rebuild their personal lives. Most
cases were domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, which
existed separately and overlapped with each other. The majority of
survivors&rsquo; experiences of sexual assault were in domestic violence.
There were also cases of sexual assault in human trafficking. Some women
married unsuitable people because they wanted to immigrate to the United
States, and thus experienced relationships filled with violence. Some
women were lured into economic and sexual exploitation by traffickers
under the pretext of getting a job. As a result,
to them, nightmares didn’t always happen all at once but more often one
after another.</p><p>They all have their own names, but if it comes down to one, we tend to call
them &ldquo;victims.&rdquo; However, in Gezhou’s eyes, she prefers to call
them &ldquo;survivors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most of our clients have too much going wrong in their lives. &ldquo;We hope that
through this change in the usage of identity terms, we can convey more
positive feelings to them, <span>starting from the dribs and drabs, finding their
shining points, changing the direction of things, and making them think they
are doing a good job and feeling their own energy.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, a change in name alone is not enough. It seems that an equal and
trustworthy inner connection is necessary to truly get inside the
interviewees’ hearts.</p><p>Gezhou’s second job involved dealing with another group of people—African
Americans. The job required Gezhou to reach out to local communities and
the environment where survivors lived. Because of the huge differences in
the environment in which they grew up, the survivors had completely
different life experiences from those in Gezhou and suffered from
intergenerational trauma. In this job experience, Gezhou was constantly
trying to get to know different people, empathize with them, and connect
with them.</p><p>&ldquo;We’re all so different, but there’s an instinctive desire for this connection in
every one of us.&rdquo; The attention, support, and praise you give them can be a
great connection builder. &ldquo;<span>I used to focus more on techniques
and therapeutic approaches, but these experiences have taught me that
making an equal connection with people is the foundation of therapy.</span>&rdquo;</p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/3.jpeg class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>Healing others means empowering them to heal themselves.</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><p>Gezhou often does individual counseling in the areas of emotional
management, marital relationships, personal growth, and interpersonal
relationship management. <span>Among these four areas, she always believes that
personal growth is the ultimate goal for each person.</span></p><p>&ldquo;All four areas are actually interconnected.&rdquo; However, compared to personal
growth, the other three areas mostly become the focus of one’s attention at
different stages of life, but they all ultimately aim at personal growth, so it
can be said that personal growth covers the other three areas. In the cases I
have worked with, when respondents do not have greater distress in the
other three areas, their aim is often to learn a little more about themselves to
help them grow better.</p><p>And among the different groups she has worked with, when it comes to
attributing psychological problems, she agrees: &ldquo;Even though their problems
are different, the general attribution from a psychological perspective is
back to themselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;The way you are, your traits, and your
upbringing all blend into you and thus shape the logic of your behavior.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking to this point, we seem to be gradually realizing that <span>the cure that
brings people back to life in the desert is not only the verdant oasis but also
the soul that is full of faith and keeps healing itself. For Gezhou, healing
others is often about helping them to have the ability to heal themselves.</span></p><p>This statement is especially for the girls.</p><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>Remember to dress what is in your closet in a better way</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><p>&ldquo;When helping women recognize and reshape their values, we always want
to help them tap into their inner strengths, support them in becoming more
stable and independent individuals, and empower themselves more from
their past experiences.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like how girls always want to go out and buy
new clothes, but actually have a lot of clothes in their closet already.&rdquo;</p><p>Gezhou used an analogy that impressed us a lot when talking about
women’s self-growth.</p><p>&ldquo;The restrictions and constraints imposed on women by society and
women’s own internalization of them are often the underlying factors that
cause women to suffer.&rdquo; We need to spend a long time struggling with
external constraints as well as with ourselves. &ldquo;<span>While constantly breaking
through external limitations, it is also important to explore how to accept the
inner self and accept that we are inevitably held in its grip.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>If one is unable to deal with the ego and does not know how to reconcile with
oneself, one may fall into the adversity of self-denial.</p><p>&ldquo;For example, when we encourage survivors of domestic violence that they
actually have the strength to cope with domestic violence, most survivors still
fall into a deep sense of self-blame.&rdquo; They will think that&rsquo;s why they didn’t
do well even though they had the strength. However, even with this
knowledge, we are still inevitably held back by internal or external factors.
&ldquo;<span>What has happened has happened, and what we need more of is to
reconcile with our past selves, grasp our energy, and look at a brighter
future.</span>&rdquo;</p><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/4.jpeg class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>More topics on women’s psychological growth</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><div class="m-4 px-5 py-4" style=background-color:#fef8f4><p></p><p class="text-black font-weight-normal">That’s all about Gezhou’s own story for now; the next one is with us.</p><p class="text-black font-weight-normal">It’s been several years since she last did counseling work purely for women's
groups. Like a kind of return after growth, Gezhou now carries a beginner’s
mind to heal others and a more mature experience to become a counseling
volunteer at Avoice. In her own way, she hopes to help women build a better
self. We also took this opportunity to learn more about topics of women’s
psychological growth.</p></div><div class=text-center><h3>1. Self-Protection and Trauma Recovery in Marital Relationships</h3></div><p>Rather than how to protect ourselves and prevent harm in a marital
relationship, I prefer to say how to stick to ourselves in a marital relationship,
which is a more positive emphasis. <span>In a relationship, when we find it
uncomfortable, we cannot ignore this feeling even if the outside world does
not agree with it.</span> We need to trust our gut feelings in the relationship, find
ways to express our discomfort, and communicate with our partner.
Exposing problems can help us set better boundaries. In addition, we can
seek professional counseling to help us better understand the situation.</p><p>Women are inherently more vulnerable to the trauma caused by
relationships compared to men. This kind of trauma may stem from an early
relationship with a nurturer or from an intimate relationship. Eye movement
desensitization therapy is very effective in healing such trauma.
In this therapy, we first need the survivors to retell the experience to
mobilize the past trauma, and in doing so, we professionally help them to
reconceptualize the experience to the point of desensitizing to the
trauma. Survivors may still have natural reactions to the past experience,
but they will not be as intense as before. After desensitization, survivors will
have more psychological energy to repair themselves and redefine the
experience.</p><div class=text-center><h3>2. The role of artistic healing for women</h3></div><p>On the one hand, it lies in expression, and on the other hand,
it’s about empowerment. No matter what art one is learning, it’s like learning
a different language or a different way of expressing yourself. Language
itself has limitations, while art, like dance, is able to convey information
visually with body language, and this kind of expression through the body is
a pleasure for me—not to mention that movement itself brings a lot of
hormones for happiness! In addition, in the process of creating art, we are
able to produce different works based on our own characteristics. This kind
of creation is not necessarily artistic, but it has an extraordinary meaning for
ourselves—it is a reflection of our own and can help us achieve
self-empowerment.</p><br><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><div class=text-center><span style=font-size:18px>Finally, let’s all be our own oasis.</span></div><hr style="border:1px solid #ee7919"><br><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/5.jpeg class="my-4 mx-auto d-block" width=95%><br><br><div style=text-align:center><img src=/images/illustrations/stories/20221103_everyone_is_an_oasis/6.jpeg style=border-radius:50% width=50%></div><br><br><div class=text-center style=font-size:18px>李戈洲 Gezhou Li</div><br><br><div style="width:50%;margin:0 auto"><ul><li>Yeshiva University心理咨询硕士毕业</li><li>纽约州执证心理咨询师（LMHC）</li><li>受训于Milton Erickson Foundation和William Alanson White Institute</li><li>擅长行为认知疗法（CBT）、辩证行为疗法（DBT）、眼动脱敏再处理疗法（EMDR）和艾瑞克森催眠疗法。</li><li>曾任纽约市Community Counseling and Mediation心理咨询诊所主任(clinical director)及督导（supervisor）</li><li>微信工作联系：evelynlilmhc</li></ul></div><p><br><br></p><div class="card p-4 border-warning"><div class=card-body><span>Avoice海外华人女性保护项目介绍链接：</span>
